## Continuous integration 

We were not able to display the usual cucumber reports in Jenkins for this repository because the `behave` reports are not compatible with the `cucumber` reports (see e.g. [this reference](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/6638934-behave-json-reports-are-incompatible-with-cucumber-ones)). Therefore our `Jenkinsfile` makes use of the `junit` framework to output acceptance test results.

## Development's instructions

### Getting started

1. Init and update `saleor` submodule

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Saleor software will then be accessible at the latest release we granted access to.

2. Create virtual environment

```
virtualenv venv
```

3. Install dependencies

```
./scripts/install/install.sh
./scripts/install/install-dev.sh
```

4. Add the relevant environment variables to the virtual environment (in the file `venv/bin/activate`):

```
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/saleor:$PYTHONPATH
export SECRET_KEY=hahahaha
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=shopozor.settings
```

Make sure that the path to `saleor` module is correctly displayed by the following command in the python shell:

1. run the python shell

```
python manage.py shell
```

2. double-check the python path:

```
import sys
for path in sys.path:
    print(path)
```

### Testing saleor

The purpose of the `shopozor-backend` project is to provide the Shopozor's frontends with a backend. In particular, this means that we don't care at all about saleor's frontend developments. However, it can be that you need to run saleor's tests for some reason. In that case, we recommend you read [these instructions](https://github.com/softozor/shopozor-configuration/blob/master/doc/tests/unit-tests.md).
